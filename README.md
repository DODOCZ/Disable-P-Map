### 2. **Prepare Your Project for GitHub:**

In Visual Studio, make sure your project is initialized as a Git repository:

- Open the **Solution Explorer**.
- Right-click on your solution and select **"Add to Source Control"** if it’s not already added.
- If it's already a Git repository, you’ll see a `.git` folder in your project directory.

### 3. **Commit and Push to GitHub:**

1. **Stage and Commit Your Changes:**
   - Go to the **Team Explorer** tab in Visual Studio.
   - Click on **"Changes"** to see your uncommitted changes.
   - Add a commit message like "Initial commit with README" and click **"Commit All"**.

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   - If you haven't already connected your project to a GitHub repository:
     - Click on **"Sync"** in the **Team Explorer**.
     - Under **"Push to Remote Repository"**, click **"Publish to GitHub"**.
     - Sign in to GitHub if prompted, and create a new repository.
   - Once your repository is set up, push your changes.

### 4. **Review on GitHub:**

After pushing, go to your GitHub repository to ensure everything was uploaded correctly, and the `README.md` is displayed as expected on the repository's homepage.

This setup will allow you to easily share your project on GitHub with a well-documented `README.md` file.
